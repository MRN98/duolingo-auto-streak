## Workflows

### ðŸ”¥ Streak Keeper

This project uses GitHub Actions scheduled workflow to keep your streak alive. The workflow can be viewed [here](.github/workflows/streak-keeper.yml).

### ðŸ“š Study

This repository can also "study" lessons for you. This will give you XP so you won't get demoted never again! This workflow uses [workflow_dispatch](https://docs.github.com/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows#workflow_dispatch) to trigger the study session. You can choose the number of lessons to be done. The workflow can be viewed [here](.github/workflows/study.yml).

## Caveats

- This project won't help with your daily or friend quests, it can only earn XP to move up the league rank;
- This project won't do real lessons or stories, only practices, so it won't affect your learning path;
